# Data_Augmentation_Using_Keras
This Repository Has Step-wise Flow For Data Augmentation Using Keras

## Data Augmentation
In this repository, a simple yet effective method to build a powerful image classifier, using only very few training examples is shown, where few images is transformed into a multi image dataset.

## Steps Involved

1. Collect images in a folder
2. Augment the images and store in another folder in same working directory
3. Combine the images into a single folder
